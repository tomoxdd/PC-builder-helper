Choosing the components for your first pc build can be a struggle. That is why I created this simple cmd-based python program to help you choose the components for your first pc build.
Disclaimer: This file does not replace professional advice.

Includes:
  Database of gpus ranging from gtx 1050 ti to rtx 5090
  Cpu databases from ryzen 1000 to ryzen 9000 and intel 8th gen to intel core ultra generations
  Database of gpus with resolution capabilities

What does it help with?:
  Checks if your psu wattage is enough for your gpu
  Checks if your cpu is compatible with your socket
  Checks compatibility of your ram with your motherboard
  Recommends you ssd setups
  Checks if your gpu is capable of a resolution and settings 

How to use:
  1. Download python from the official website
  2. Run the executable
  3. The setup will guide you through the installation process
  4. After installing python download the pcbuilder.py file from my repository
  5. Run the file and enter your components

Good luck with the build!
